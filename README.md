# Algorithm-Implementation-in-Python
BFS,DFS,UCS,GUCS &amp; A* Search Algorithm Implementation in Python


* [search.py](search.py) contains the search algorithms and necessary data structures.
* [problem.py](problem.py) contains the definition of a few problems, such as N-Queens, 8-Puzzle, and Travel.
* [example_test.py](example_test.py) has a few examples on how to run these search algorithms.
* [example_output.txt](example_output.txt) is the output of running example-test.py.
* [run.py](run.py) code for Algorithms
 

# Implemented tasks are as follow :

1. Implementation of `breadth_first_search` in search.py  

2. Implementation of `depth_first_search` in search.py  

3. Implementation of `astar_search` in search.py  

4. Implementations of `uniform_cost_search` and `greedy_best_first_search`  


# How to Run Programm  

1. execute 'run.py' as ==> run `python run.py > out.txt`
